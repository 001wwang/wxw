# Welcome!

Recently, I haven't been writing or reading nearly enough. I also haven't been
building nearly enough. There are a billion excuses I could come up with, but
there's no point in rationalizing what **could** have been (especially since I
don't regret the other things I've been up to).

Consider this blog a first step. It's a build-in-progress, a platform for
producing written work, and a place for readers. It ticks all my boxes.

Writing has always been my preferred method to organize my thoughts and lacquer
my memories. But, since middle school, my writing's been disorganized. I could
build a fortress out of my scattered notebooks, spent agendas, and hastily
skribbled Notability pages. So, rather than lose them, I'm bringing my best
ideas and most helpful insights here: for me to remember and others to enjoy.

# The Hardest Thing

From what I've seen, there are a lot of hard things about blogging. Lack of new
ideas, lack of time, lack of effort. Instead, I'm focusing on the hardest thing,
in hopes that it solves the rest: building an audience. Right now, this first
post is so difficult to write because I don't know who it's for. For future me?
Or for you, whoever you are?

But, I have a two-step plan. I don't know my audience because I don't know my
content. Will it be

- The journey of a new grad in software engineering?
- My favorite hikes in Southern California?
- How to build web applications or debug operating systems or explore functional
  programming?

I'm going to figure it out non-systematically, with as much trial and error as I
can stand to find out what I enjoy. That's step one.

And step two? Write more, and write better. I'm going to do a lot of writing
before I ever get to step two, but, once I figure out my content, I have to
write about it better than anyone else. Otherwise, who would read what I have to
say? Then I'm hoping, with a dash of luck, an audience will come.

# Stick Around!

I'm graduating soon, and if there's anything I've realized in undergrad, it's
that there's a lot left for me to learn. I'm looking forward to documenting the
interesting, the intuitive, and the downright insane things life has to offer.

I'm sure this website will evolve in form and function over time, and I hope you
stick around for the ride.
