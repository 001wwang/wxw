# Introduction

Before we build anything, it's important to know what we're actually building.
What is a blog?

For the purposes of this tutorial, **a blog is a collection of written texts**
where each text can be separately displayed as a page on a website. The
collection of texts should be easily modifiable (e.g. create post, delete post,
update post). That's probably what you already had in mind, and I don't mean to
oversimplify. I just like to set expectations straight.

I'm going to show you how to build a blog that excels in

1.  **Markdown based editing**

    Markdown is ubiquitous. Online and offline text editors are readily
    available for you to use to craft your posts.

2.  **Getting out of your way**

    Blogging isn't about the website. It's about the content. This blog makes
    publishing as easy as dropping MDX files into a folder and pushing those
    files up to Github (presuming you deploy on Vercel or a similar hosting
    service).

3.  **Fast set up and customization**

    This guide isn't very long. I'm constantly amazed by the packages and
    tooling freely available online to build complex services: blogging is no
    exception. You're going to stitch together a few useful packages that will
    handle most of the work. From there, your creativity is the limit.

# FAQ

- Why Next.js instead of [insert JavaScript framework here]?

I can't provide an exceptional answer to this question beyond. Next.js does a
lot out of the box. You don't have to deal with a lot of configuration to get
static and server rendering of pages (good for performance), TypeScript support
(good for development experience), bundling (good for performance), route
creation (good for development experience), etc. Check out the
[official website](nextjs.org) for more.

When I was getting started, I focused too much on the "right" framework. There
is no "right" framework. One of the best (and worst?) things about web
development is that you're allowed to have opinions. Choose the JavaScript
framework that lets you focus on more important things: the product, the
algorithms, the special sauce. Next.js isn't the only one that does a lot for
you out-of-the-box, so it might come down to ergonomics. How does it feel?

- Why MDX?

Think of MDX as Markdown + code! It'll let you enrich the written word with
interactive experiences that help set your blog apart. Of course, feel free to
forget MDX and use regular markdown. MDX isn't necessary if you're only worried
about prose.

- Why build instead of [buy/clone/etc.]?

No other reason than to learn and have fun! There are thousands of
production-ready services and templates out there for blogging, and that's going
to be the fastest way to start.

# Setting Up:

## Next.js with TypeScript

Get a Next.js project set up on your machine by running

```bash
npx create-next-app [your-directory-name]
```

in your terminal. This takes care of a lot of boilerplate configuration on our
behalf, setting up all the necessary tooling and packages for us to begin
development.

To get TypeScript going,

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

in your root directory, and run `yarn dev` to start a development server. It
should prompt you with a command to install the necessary TypeScript packages.
An example is below.

```bash
yarn add -D typescript @types/react @types/node
```

All set!

## MDX

There are two options for creating posts with MDX.

1.  `next/mdx`

    You can use the `next/mdx` package and create posts with a .mdx extension in
    the standard `pages` folder of your project. These blog posts will be
    automatically routed and served like any other page.

2.  `next-mdx-remote` (or similar)

    You can pull posts from some other source (remote storage, elsewhere on your
    file system, etc.) via `next-mdx-remote`. Then, we can create a dynamic
    route in `pages` that will be configured to display each of your posts.

I'll show you the latter as it offers more flexibilty and may serve more use
cases. Go ahead and run

```shell
yarn add next-mdx-remote
```

to pull `next-mdx-remote` into the project.

## Create Example Post

Write an MDX post or two as samples to use for the rest of this guide. It's
helpful to have some testing data to follow along with.

I'll assume you have these posts in a folder named `posts`.

# Building:

## Create a dynamic route

Part of Next.js magic is its ability to create routes automatically from the
files in your `pages` folder. For example, a file named `about.tsx` will
automatically create a route on your website `[website]/about` that displays the
React component exported from `about.tsx`. This is a **static route**, meaning
the filename dictates the route name.

We're going to use a **dynamic route** meaning the URL will be generated
according to some variable data. In this case, we want our posts to show up at
the URL `/blog/[postname]` where `[postname]` is a variable representing the
filenames of our posts.

You might see some documentation refer to a post's "slug" when talking about
dynamic routing for blogs. Slug is just a journalistic term for the name of an
article.

Create this file structure in `pages`: `/pages/blog/[postname].tsx` (a folder
named `blog` and a file named `[postname].tsx`, and the brackets _are_
necessary).

## Implement getStaticPaths()

In `[postname].tsx`, we're going to implement and export a function called
`getStaticPaths` which Next.js will use to determine how the paths for this file
will be created. Remember, we want our paths to be our post names, and our post
names are simply the filenames (minus the extension) of our .mdx posts.

Thus, we need to read the `posts` directory, and get the filenames of all our
posts. Luckily, Node exposes a simple filesystem utility function
`readdirSync()` which will do exactly that.

```typescript
readdirSync("posts"); // read the posts folder and return filename strings
```

`getStaticPaths` returns an object with two parameters: `paths` and `fallback`.
We'll set `fallback` to false (this means any path not specified in the `paths`
param will lead to a 404 error). `paths` is an array of objects where each
object is structured as

```json
{
    params: {
        [insert route variable]: [insert value]
    }
}
```

Our "route variable" is `postname` and the corresponding values will be the
filenames.

Clearly, the vanilla output of `readdirSync` does not work as a return value.
We'll use JavaScript's `map` to transform the output into the value expected by
`paths`.

```typescript
const postnames = readdirSync("posts").map((f) => ({
  params: { postname: f.replace(".mdx", "") }, // get rid of the file extension
}));
```

We can then return the necessary object with `paths` mapping to `postnames`. The
full code is below.

```typescript
export const getStaticPaths: GetStaticPaths = async () => {
  const postnames = readdirSync("posts").map((f) => ({
    params: { postname: f.replace(".mdx", "") },
  }));

  return { paths: postnames, fallback: false };
};
```

## Implement getStaticProps()

If you try to navigate to `[localhost]/blog/[some postname]` now, you'll still
get an error.

`getStaticPaths` actually feeds into `getStaticProps` which passes React props
into the component exported by our `[postname].tsx` file. We must have at least
some implementation of `getStaticPaths` for us to visit
`[localhost]/blog/[some postname]`.

A minimal skeleton would look like

```typescript
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  // params comes from our getStaticPaths implementation
  return {
    props: {},
  };
};
```

What should we actually do in `getStaticProps`? The function is run server side
(at build time) to fetch data needed to render your page. We need post data to
render our post page. Thus, we'll read the post from our local `posts` folder
and pass it as a return value in `props`. Note that this is also where you could
fetch your posts from a Content Management System, database, or other remote
storage.

We use `readFileSync`, another Node-provided utility, to read our post file in
as a buffer.

```typescript
readFileSync(join(params.postname + ".mdx"));
```

And now it's finally time to introduce `next-mdx-remote`. Two core functions
exposed by `next-mdx-remote` let us read MDX content (formatted as a string) and
later hydrate MDX with functionality. We read the content in `getStaticProps`
and hydrate the content in the exported component for this page (the
`[postname].tsx` page). Read more about next-mdx-remote
[here](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).

In other words, we call `renderToString` on our file contents, and return the
output as a prop.

```javascript
// renderToString returns a Promise which cannot be returned, thus await it
const mdxSource = await renderToString(
  // convert to string as readFileSync returns a buffer
  readFileSync(join(params.postname + ".mdx")).toString()
);
```

Finally, we return `mdxSource` within the props that our component will receive.
Fully, this looks like

```javascript
export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async ({ params }) => {
  const mdxSource = await renderToString(
    readFileSync(join("posts", params.postname + ".mdx")).toString()
  );

  return {
    props: { src: mdxSource },
  };
};
```

## Create a Post Component

Lastly, we need to create a component containing our MDX content. We'll keep it
simple for the sake of this guide, but it'd be easy to continue building a nice
layout, styling, etc. for posts.

First, let's call `hydrate` on the `src` prop that we retrieve from
`getStaticProps`. `hydrate` is run on client side, and effectively loads the
JavaScript necessary to run any components that you've included in your MDX.
We'll take its return value and use it within our component.

```javascript
// the second arg for hydrate is any components you've included in your MDX files
// keeping it simple, we'll not include any for now
const content = hydrate(src, { components: {} });
```

We're effectively all set! We can build a simple skeleton component (some
`div`'s) and some styling to view our post with. In full, our component looks
like

```javascript
const Post: React.FC<Props> = ({ src }) => {
  const content = hydrate(src, { components: {} });
  return (
    <div className="blog">
      <div className="post">{content}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Our simple styling to center the content looks like

```css
.blog {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
}

.post {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  width: 60ch;
}
```

I've included the styling in the `globals.css` file that Next.js auto-generates
during the `create-next-app` process.

And, you're done! When you view `[localhost]/blog/[postname]` on your
development server, you should see your blog post rendered to the screen. It
might be a little barebones, but now its up to you to play around and
experiment!

Here's my end result.

<div style={{ outline: "2px dashed black" }}>
  <img src="../simple-blog.png" />
</div>
