# Introduction

Before we build anything, it's important to know what we're actually building.
What is a blog?

For the purposes of this tutorial, **a blog is a collection of written texts**
where each text can be separately displayed as a page on a website. The
collection of texts should be easily modifiable (e.g. create post, delete post,
update post). That's probably what you already had in mind, and I don't mean to
oversimplify. I just like to set expectations straight.

I'm going to show you how to build a blog that excels in three areas.

1.  **All Markdown based editing**

    Markdown is ubiquitous. Online and offline text editors are readily
    available for you to use to craft your posts.

2.  **Statically served**

    Pages are generated at build-time using Next.js static site generation
    tooling. Your readers won't be bogged down by the blog.

3.  **Gets out of your way**

    Ultimately, blogging isn't about the website. It's about the content. This
    blog features an easy publishing pipeline, so you can focus on what matters.
    Drop MDX files into a folder, and you're set.
